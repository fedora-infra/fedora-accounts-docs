[#twofactor]
== How do I add and use two-factor authentication?

Noggin features the ability to configure and user two-factor
authentication through the user of OTP tokens. by default, Noggin
generates Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) tokens, which can be used
with popular authentication apps such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator[Google Authenticator]
and https://freeotp.github.io/[FreeOTP].

To create an OTP token in Noggin, go to the OTP tab in the user
settings, and click the *Add OTP Token* button:

Next, add a name for the token and provide your password again.
Something descriptive like the name of the app you are adding the token
to might prove useful it you decide to add more tokens later:

Your token is now created. Using your chosen authenticator application,
scan the QR code and add it to your app.

Next time you log in to Noggin, you will need to enter in your password
followed by the 6 digit OTP code generated by your chosen authenticator
app.

[#join-group]
== How do I become a member of a group?

Group Sponsors have the ability to add new members to the group. A group
should provide the information required to request access to the group,
otherwise contact a group sponsor directly.

Previously, In FAS2, a user could request access to a group, which a
group admininstrator could either approve or deny. In Fedora Accounts, users are
simply just added to the group by a sponsor after requesting access
through other channels for that group, such as email or IRC.

[#leave-group]
== How do I stop being a member of a group?

As a group member, you can choose to leave a group at anytime. Press the
leave group button on the group detail page:

If you are the sponsor of a group, you can simply remove yourself from
the group, as you would remove any other user.

[#sponsorwhat]
== What is a group sponsor?

Groups in Fedora Accounts have users with a special _sponsor_ privilege. If a
user is a sponsor of a group, they are able to add and remove group
members. The sponsors of a group are listed above the group members.

Previously in FAS2, groups had special _admininstrator_ users that had
the ability to add both new members and new admininstrators to a group.
In Noggin, groups have _Sponsors_ which have the ability to add new
members to a group.
